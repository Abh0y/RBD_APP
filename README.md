Login/Logout System with Role-Based Admin Panel
Objective
Develop a secure login/logout system with an admin panel featuring a dynamic dashboard layout and menu options based on user roles. The system supports the following roles:

Super Admin
Admin
Manager
Normal User
Features & Requirements
1. Authentication System
Login/Logout Functionality: Implement secure login and logout functionality.
Session Management: Use authentication tokens (e.g., JWT) or session management to maintain user sessions.
Password Security: Ensure password encryption and secure storage of user credentials.
2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
User Roles: Assign roles to users including Super Admin, Admin, Manager, and Normal User.
Access Control: Ensure each role has specific access to features and menu items within the admin panel.
Route Protection: Implement middleware or guards to protect routes and ensure only authorized users can access certain sections.
3. Admin Panel Dashboard
Super Admin:

Access to all features, including user management, role assignment, and system settings.
Admin:

Access to most features, excluding some critical system settings and role assignment.
Manager:

Access to specific sections, such as reports, team management, and certain data entries.
Normal User:

Basic access, primarily to view personal data or perform limited actions.
The dashboard layout should dynamically adjust based on the logged-in user's role.

4. Menu & Layout Customization
UI Design: Design a responsive and intuitive user interface (UI) for the admin panel.
Dynamic Menu: Menu items should be dynamically rendered based on the user's role.
Role-Based Menus: Ensure that each user role only sees the menu options relevant to their permissions.
5. User Management
Super Admin:
Can create, read, update, and delete users, and assign roles.
Admin:
Can manage users but with some restrictions (e.g., cannot assign Super Admin roles).
Manager:
Can view and manage their team members.
Normal User:
Can view and edit their own profile.
6. Security Considerations
CSRF Protection: Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
Secure Coding: Use secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)).
Session Handling: Ensure proper session handling with timeouts for inactivity.
7. Technology Stack
Frontend: React 
Backend: Node.js with Express 
Database: MongoDB 
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)
